        <h1>The History of Oregon</h1>
        <p>Oregon's story is a captivating narrative of diverse landscapes, vibrant cultures, and a pioneering spirit. From the ancient Native American tribes who first called this land home to the arrival of explorers, settlers, and modern-day innovators, Oregon's history is a rich tapestry woven over millennia.</p>

        <h2>Native People of Oregon</h2>
        <p>Oregon's history begins with its Native American inhabitants, who have lived in the region for over 15,000 years. Numerous tribes thrived across the diverse landscapes, each with unique cultures, languages, and traditions. The Chinookan peoples along the Columbia River were renowned for their trade networks and maritime skills. In the interior, tribes like the Klamath, Modoc, and Paiute adapted to the high desert environment. The coastal tribes, such as the Tillamook and Coos, relied on the rich resources of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
        <p>These tribes had complex social structures, sophisticated resource management practices, and rich oral traditions. Their deep connection to the land shaped their cultures and continues to influence the region today. The arrival of European explorers and settlers brought devastating changes, including disease, displacement, and conflict, profoundly impacting the Native populations.</p>

        <h2>Exploration and Settlement</h2>
        <p>European exploration of the Oregon coast began in the 16th century, with Spanish and English explorers charting the coastline. However, significant European presence didn't occur until the late 18th and early 19th centuries with the arrival of fur traders from various nations. The lucrative fur trade attracted both maritime and overland expeditions, leading to the establishment of trading posts and increased interaction with Native tribes.</p>
        <p>The early 19th century saw increasing American interest in the Oregon Country, fueled by stories of fertile lands and abundant resources. The Oregon Trail, a grueling 2,000-mile overland route, became the primary means of westward migration, bringing thousands of settlers to the region in the 1840s and 1850s. This influx of settlers led to conflicts with Native Americans over land and resources, culminating in treaties and the establishment of reservations.</p>

    <section id="statehood">
        <h2>Statehood and Growth</h2>
        <p>Oregon officially became the 33rd state of the United States on February 14, 1859. The newly formed state faced challenges of establishing governance, infrastructure, and resolving ongoing tensions with Native American tribes. The latter half of the 19th century saw the growth of agriculture, particularly wheat farming in the Willamette Valley, and the rise of the timber industry, which became a dominant force in Oregon's economy.</p>
        <p>The arrival of railroads in the late 19th century connected Oregon to the rest of the country, facilitating trade and further settlement. This period also saw the development of cities like Portland, which became a major port and commercial center.</p>

    <section id="20th-century">
        <h2>The 20th Century</h2>
        <p>The 20th century brought significant changes to Oregon. The early part of the century saw continued growth in agriculture, logging, and fishing. World War I and World War II had a profound impact on the state, boosting its economy and bringing new industries. The post-war era saw diversification of the economy, with the growth of manufacturing, technology, and tourism.</p>
        <p>Oregon also developed a strong environmental consciousness in the 20th century, with the passage of landmark legislation aimed at protecting its natural resources. This commitment to conservation has shaped Oregon's identity and continues to be a defining characteristic of the state.</p>

    <section id="modern-oregon">
        <h2>Modern Oregon</h2>
        <p>Today, Oregon is known for its diverse economy, stunning natural beauty, and progressive values. It is a state of contrasts, with vibrant urban centers like Portland and Eugene alongside vast forests, mountains, and deserts. The state's economy is driven by a mix of industries, including technology, agriculture, tourism, and outdoor recreation.</p>
        <p>Oregon continues to grapple with challenges related to affordable housing, income inequality, and environmental sustainability. However, the state's history of innovation, resilience, and commitment to its unique identity suggests that it will continue to evolve and adapt in the 21st century and beyond.</p>
